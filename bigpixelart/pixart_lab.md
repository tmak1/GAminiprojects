# big pixel art

It's paint with big pixels!!!

### Step 1

* add a sqaure div to represent a brush box. 
* add a form and have a input box and button inside. label the button set color
* When I click the "Set Color" button, it should change the color of the brush box div to the color I specify in the input field. expect the user type in a **valid CSS color name**.
* Use the DOM API to find the element and add event listeners to handle the set color action


### Step 2

* The same thing should happen when I press the enter key from inside the input field instead of the button

### Step 3

* Create 2000 divs with the "pixel" class and append them to the body. The pixel class should be styled as a square around 50px by 50px. (you can make the square a little bit bigger or smaller if you want)

### Step 4

* Add functionality so that when I click on each div with the class "pixel, it changes the color of that individual square to "green"

### Step 5

* Modify your code so that when I click on each "pixel", it changes to the color I set on my brush box instead of "green" every time.

### Step 6

* Change the event that changes your pixels colors from 'click' to 'mouseover'.

### Step 7

* add another form to allow users to pick a movie poster with a movie title using the OMDB API.
* set the background of your canvas to the movie poster fetched from the api.

### Step 8

* feel free to tweak the styling, the size and number of pixels to make it look pretty.
