# Infinite Giphy

### step 1

When the user enters a search term, return 10 images from Giphy, and arrange them vertically on the page.

Your nagging colleague has requested that for **every** giphy you are adding. Use the following markup structure

```html
  <article>
    <img src="dt-says-dont-just-copy-and-paste-without-reading">
  </article>
```

When the user scrolls near to the bottom of the page, fetch the next 10 giphy and append to page. When the user scrolls near the bottom again, repeat!

### step 2

Our users complains infinity scrolling gives them enxiety and nightmares.

We decided to modify the app so that infinite scroll will only apply to the first 5 request. After that show a button that a user can click to load more. 

### step 3 (optional)

add a button next to every giphy so that when clicked that giphy shake like the party parrot.
